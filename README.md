Why I want to work in the team:
------------------------------
I have always been interested in Machine Learning. I have been learning machine learning by myself for quite a while now and I have already completed Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning. I feel that joining Abhiyaan will help broaden my knowledge about machine learning and also put my knowledge to practical use. I also am interested in image processing and due to my interest, I had already learned a bit about it. I use an open cv tool called haar cascades to process images but while doing the tasks for Abhiyan I got to know that we can also use r-cnn to process images so started learning how to use r-cnn. If the team requires me learning something new I am ready to do it as I am always looking forward to learning new things. I am a team player and I work well in teams. The fact that cars can drive themselves without a human being controlling them fascinates me and I want to be part of Abhiyaan because I want to help create them.
